## Motivation:

Auctions work for buyers and sellers alike because everyone involved wins. 

In early 2020, many auctioneers were obliged to transition to online auctions because of the COVID-19 pandemic. But, it was perhaps the catalyst in a necessary shift to best serve all buyers and sellers. 

In Bangladesh, currently there’s not a single dedicated popular online auction site.

What we intend to do is to create a lively web application that will-

Be easy to use 
Show live actions and results  
Eliminate long negotiation periods, save the hassle of negotiating
Deadlines will motivate the market to make real offers to buy real quick
A structured sale reduces risk and maximizes value
Buyers are treated fairly and on the same terms as others competing for the same product
In an auction the buyers know that they are only competing against other buyers and that the seller is not bidding, that fuels the mentality
Instant engagement from marketing (Bidders can go from an email to bidding in 5 seconds, so they won’t forget about the auction)
More buyers, larger reach
No moving and onsite activity, save time and money
